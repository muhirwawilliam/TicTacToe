# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Introduction
This Tic-Tac-Toe game is a personal project created as part of my journey to become a proficient front-end developer. This project has been the most challenging I've undertaken so far, serving as a platform to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and improve my development skills.

## Project Overview
The game implements the classic Tic-Tac-Toe logic with an intuitive and interactive user interface. Players can take turns marking their moves and see the game progress in real-time.

## Features
- **Playable Grid**: Users can click on the grid to make their moves.
- **Win Detection**: The game detects winning combinations and displays the result.
- **Restart Functionality**: Users can restart the game after a win or a draw.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the game layout.
- **CSS**: For styling the game board and interface.
- **JavaScript**: For game logic, user interaction, and DOM manipulation.

## Development Experience
This project has been a significant learning experience for me as I am currently focusing on mastering JavaScript. Throughout the development process, I encountered several challenges and used various resources to overcome them:
- **Documentation**: I extensively referenced JavaScript documentation to understand and implement specific functionalities.
- **Stack Overflow**: Leveraged community knowledge to troubleshoot and resolve issues.
- **ChatGPT**: Consulted with ChatGPT for guidance on complex problems and code optimization.

## Learning Outcomes
- **JavaScript Proficiency**: Gained a deeper understanding of JavaScript, including advanced topics like event handling and game logic.
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Improved my ability to debug and solve programming challenges with the help of external resources.
- **Front-End Development**: Enhanced my skills in creating interactive and visually appealing web applications.

## Future Goals
I am committed to continuing my learning journey and am eager to tackle more complex projects. This experience has motivated me to further explore JavaScript and new frameworks to build more sophisticated applications in the future.
